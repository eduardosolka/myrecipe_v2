Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Drop the beans in and and when it returns to a boil, cook them for 2-3 minutes, until they are just cooked through, but still crisp and bright green. Drain and cool immediately to stop the cooking process: them in a bowl and keep filling it will cold water, draining it, and repeating until they are cool; or transfer them to a bowl of ice water to cool.

Fill a large pot half way with water. Add 2 teaspoons salt and bring to a boil. Transfer potato slices to boiling water. When water returns to a simmer, cook potato slices for about 5 minutes, until they are just cooked through. (They will soften a bit more as they cool) Drain water from potatoes and transfer them to a large bowl. Sprinkle them with salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon of vinegar. Toss gently and let them cool for 10 minutes or so. Potatoes can be stored overnight in an airtight container in the fridge.

Line a large platter with the lettuce leaves (trick: if the leaves curl too much, crack the thick white spines gently to help them lie flat) Arrange ingredients in separate piles around the platter. I like to start with the tuna - slightly off center - and work around it. Sprinkle tomatoes, green beans, eggs and tuna with little salt and pepper.
