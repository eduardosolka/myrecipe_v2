Saute until fragrant and just starting to brown and then add the onions, bay leaves, green cardamom, black cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Turn down the heat to medium low and fry the onions, stirring periodically until they are a caramel color and have reduced to about 1/4 of their original volume (30-40 minutes). When the onions are caramelized, add the curry powder and fry until fragrant. Add the tomato juice, chicken stock and soy sauce, and turn up the heat to bring the soup to a boil. Add the chicken legs and chili peppers (optional), cover with a lid, and turn down the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for 40 minutes. While the chicken cooks, prepare all the vegetables and mix the garam masala with 1 teaspoon of salt in a small bowl.When the chicken is done, remove the chicken from the liquid and place on a wire rack over a sheet pan. Let the surface of the chicken dry out for a few minutes and then rub with a little vegetable oil and sprinkle all surfaces with the garam masala salt mixture.Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Add 1-inch of oil to a heavy bottomed pot and heat to 340 degrees F (170C) and line a wire rack with paper towels. Add the coconut milk to the curry and add salt as needed, keep it warm over low heat. Roast the chicken in the oven until the skin is golden brown (7-10 minutes).Fry each of the vegetables until they are tender but still vibrant in color. Keep in mind that some vegetables take longer than others to cook. For instance carrots will take a few minutes vs okra which will cook in a few seconds. Drain the fried vegetables on paper towels and sprinkle with the garam masala salt. To plate, pile the vegetables on the chicken and pour the curry soup around the chicken and vegetables. Serve with rice or bread.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Melt the butter in a saute pan over medium high heat and then add the garlic and ginger.","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","localizedName":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":11215,"name":"garlic","localizedName":"garlic","image":"garlic.png"},{"id":11216,"name":"ginger","localizedName":"ginger","image":"ginger.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Saute until fragrant and just starting to brown and then add the onions, bay leaves, green cardamom, black cardamom, and cinnamon stick.
