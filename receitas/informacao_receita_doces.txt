While the butter is creaming, place the Flour, Cinnamon, Baking Powder and Salt in a medium mixing bowl and whisk together.Add the 2 Eggs, Egg Yolk and Vanilla Bean Paste to the Butter mixture and beat to combine. Slowly add the Flour mixture in, beating just until combined.The batter will be very sticky and moist. Using a spatula, divide the batter in half and place each half into the center of the prepared baking sheet. With wet hands, smooth and shape each of the dough pieces into an oblong loaf about 1 inch high, 10 inches long and 5 inches wide.In a small bowl, whisk the Egg White and Water together. In another small bowl, whisk the Granulated Sugar and Ground Cinnamon together. Brush the Egg White mixture over the loaves with a pastry brush, then sprinkle with the Cinnamon-Sugar Mixture.Bake the biscotti for 35 minutes or until just golden brown, rotating the cookie sheets top to bottom and front to back, halfway in between.
