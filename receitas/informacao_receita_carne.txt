Take a half inch strip off it enough to go round the edge of the pie dish, but first brush the edge of the pie dish with milk or it won't stick. Then brush the top of the strip with milk too and then you can put the rolled out pastry on the top of the pie making sure that you press it on top of the strip all the way round. To make sure I go round the edge with a fork to make sure there is a good bind between the pastry cover and the strip or the stock may come out and spoil the look! Make a hole in the middle. With left over pastry you can decorate the pie with different shapes or letters what you like. Make a little piece of ball shaped pastry to go in the oven with the pie, this can cover the hole later when the pie is served.\nBrush the pie with milk or beaten egg all over to get the glazed look. Put the pie in the oven for ten minutes or until it is browned. Take it out and cover with metal foil and put it back in for a couple of hours, turning the heat down to 170 C. By then the steak will have cooked, but before serving test the tenderness of the meat with a skewer through the hole. Add the rest of the stock through the hole, the heat and the flour will thicken it.\nServe with gravy and mash and veg.

After all, beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner steaks go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier steaks can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Four Brix Winery Paso Robles Sangiovese, Cab, Merlot \"Scosso\" Blend with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 40 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":431741,"title":"Four Brix Winery Paso Robles Sangiovese, Cab, Merlot \"Scosso\" Blend","description":"A Californian \"Super Tuscan\" of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot is a full-gallup ride for the senses.

Let it simmer until reduced to about 1/2 cup. This will take about 15 minutes, depending on temperature.\n\nPour the stock out of the pan and set aside to use in sauce.\n\nFilet Mignon:\n\nUse a paper towel to pat each steak dry. Tie a string of cooking twine around each filet mignon steak. Tie it firm but not too tight where it starts to cut into meat. Trim off long sting ends.\n\nTIP: Make sure to season the steaks right before placing them into the hot skillet. Salt draws out moisture from food so if you salt too early, exterior of the steak will be wet and it will hinder the beautiful sear.\n\nAdd oil to the preheated pan, make sure the pan is hot before you add the steaks. Season steaks with salt and pepper on all the sides, don’t forget to season around the edges as well, and place steaks into the pan.\n\nCook steaks, flipping and touching them as little as possible, until they reach your desired temperature.\n\nThe best temperatures to cook filet mignon to is medium-rare or medium. For medium-rare, cook it to 130°-135°. For medium, cook to 135°-140° and for rare, cook it to 120°-125°.\n\nTake steaks out of the pan and set aside to rest while preparing the sauce.\n\nThe Sauce:\n\nAdd butter to the same skillet and let it melt.\n\nOnce butter is melted, add shallots and mushrooms and sauté until softened and browned. Try not to disturb them too much while sautéing so they get a browned.\n\nTake the skillet away from the heat (you can do it on the counter nearby, another burner that is off, or turn off the burnet under the skillet if using gas stove).\n\nPour in cognac over the veggies and use a long lighter (or a long match) to ignite the cognac. Ignite the fumes near the edge or the pan, not the liquid itself. Don't touch or move the pan and let the flames die down. You don't need to put it out, the flame will go out on it's own once the alcohol is burned out.\n\nReturn the skillet to the burner (or turn it the burner back on) and mix in Dijon mustard, Worcestershire, reduced beef stock, heavy whipping cream, and some salt and pepper to taste. (If there are any juices accumulated from the steaks resting, add that too!)\n\nLower the heat a little below medium and let the sauce gently simmer over medium heat for about a minute or two and take off heat.\n\nPour the sauce over the steaks right away and serve with some parsley as a garnish.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"*Flambé technique precautions: read precautions in the notes below first, before starting to cook.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Pull the steaks out of the refrigerator and out of the packaging about 30 minutes before cooking.","ingredients":[{"id":23232,"name":"steak","localizedName":"steak","image":"ribeye-raw.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":30,"unit":"minutes"}}]},{"name":"Reduce Beef Stock","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat a skillet over medium heat and when it's heated through, add beef stock.","ingredients":[{"id":6170,"name":"beef stock","localizedName":"beef stock","image":"beef-broth.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Let it simmer until reduced to about 1/2 cup.
